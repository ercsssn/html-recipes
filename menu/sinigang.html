    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        <strong>Sinigang</strong> is a sour soup native to the Philippines. 
        This recipe uses pork as the main ingredient. 
        Other proteins and seafood can also be used. 
        Beef, shrimp, fish are commonly used to cook sinigang. 
        The chicken version, on the other hand, is called sinampalukang manok. 
        I prefer to use either pork belly or buto-buto when cooking sinigang. 
        The latter refers to cuts with bones intact. 
        These are either pork neck bones, chopped spare ribs, and chopped baby back ribs. 
        Pork shoulder and ham can also be used when cooking sinigang.

    <p>
        The quality of this dish depends on the souring agent. 
        This is the ingredient that makes the soup sour. 
        The most common and widely used is unripe tamarind. 
        It is known as sampaloc in the Philippines. 
        Other fruits such as guava, tomato, bilimbi or kamias, green mango, pineapple,
         and wild mangosteen or santol can be used to make the sinigang taste sour.
